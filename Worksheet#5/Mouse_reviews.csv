"1","Mouse","TeckNet Portable Wireless Mouse","Anonymous","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2015","","Using it right now. I'm a very clumsy person and have already dropped it a few dozen times and it still works just fine. The battery life is good. Could be better. The feature that turns the mouse off after being idle for so long does help with that I assume. I am still one to turn it off when I'm done using it. The On/Off button on the bottom is great. The last mouse I had it got worn out and I had to use a pen or something to flip it, I can tell just by looking at it that this one will not have that problem. I have had it for about... I want to say about 5 months and I've replaced the battery twice.This mouse is a 5 button mouse. The 6th below the scroll wheel is only to adjust the pointer speed. You can't remap it to anything else. The count of 5 also includes the scroll wheel.Speaking of the scroll wheel lets talk about it. It is easy to use, though it is a bit stiffer than some other mice I have used. It is textured, and so far has shown no ware. As stated before I have dropped it several times already and it still works perfectly. It has about a 8 ft range that I have found so far, and at that range it is already pretty spotty. The usb connector is slightly larger than other's I have seen, but it is also textured so it is easy to get a grip on it as well. The two buttons on the side work flawlessly. They could be on the mouse further up, as I end up having to use the knuckle of my thumb to hit the closest one, but I suppose I got used to the design. It was weird at first, but now it just seems right. There is a very grippy texture on the sides of the mouse that make up for the weird design. They help you hold and keep a hold of the mouse.  The 6th above mentioned button also has an LED light in it. There are three settings, I always use the third and fastest for my games =PThe left and right click are nice. The mouse itself has a good feel to it and good pressure on the main two buttons. The button on the scroll wheel is a bit harder to press down than most mice, but nothing too bad. There is also a convenient little hole by the battery under the cover where you can put the USB dongle if you are traveling.This mouse is very durable... And I mean that. I have dropped it, or it has slid off of the arm of my couch onto my hard wood floor, several times now. A few times the buttons seemed to be stuck, but all I had to do was pop them back into place. My other mouse that I dropped about the same amount of times so far, can no longer left click. After using this mouse for so long I have cleaned it a few times. The slick texture holds oil and dead skin from your hand easily, and can get dirty very quick.10/10 Absolutely fantastic mouse for the price. I am a satisfied customer and have used this mouse constantly since I got it. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who has been looking for a durable 5 button mouse.",5,NA

Easy to connect. My computer immediately paired it. I had the Logitech MX Master, and loved it for the comfort. After three and a half years it broke down, which was probably more on me. I didn't want to pay that much for a replacement and chose the Tecknet because the color matches my Qwerkywriter. Great buy!",5,NA

And it gets heavy use, as I use it to play  video games and doom scroll on a daily, so the fact the batteries are still going strong is amazing. It's likely due to the auto-sleep feature it has built-in, which is cool.I've had no issues connecting it to the PC at all. It's as easy as slapping in some batteries, plugging in the USB thinger, and flipping the switch on the bottom. Mouse moves fine, no issues there either.The price is a steal for the quality mouse you get.",5,NA

Fortunately this is what I have but it didn't occur to me that compatibility with an operating system was a necessary consideration (and I didn't read all the details before buying).  It just says it 'may' have operating issues for more recent (Win11) operating systems.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this brand in the future though should I need one when I replace my ancient laptop.",5,NA

"12","Mouse","TeckNet Portable Wireless Mouse","mathias mirra","Reviewed in France on January 25, 2023","Works great.","Spiele werden moderner, PCs werden moderner, Software ändert sich ständig und das hat die Auswirkung, daß die Maussensibilität meiner aktuell 11 Jahren Funkmaus mit Tastatur, trotz maximal eingestellter Maussensibilität in einem und manch anderen modernen Spiele nicht mehr ausreicht um zügig und gut spielen zu können.Darum mußte eine neue Maus her. Und zwar eine Funk-Maus. Kabelsalat habe ich zu genüge.Habe mich für diese Maus entschieden, weil sie im Angebot war und einen guten Eindrcuk machte was Funktionen und sowieso DPI-EInstellmöglichkeiten laut Artikelbeschreibung betrifft.Maus wurde zum besagten Liefertermin geliefert. Eine stabile dicke Papiertüte und darin eine qualitative gute Pappschachtel mit Maus. MAus ist in extra Luftpolsterfolie eingepackt um wirklich sicher zu gehen das beim Transport nichts passieren kann.Maus getestet und bin begeistert. Batterien rein, USB-Funkstecker am PC eingesteckt und sofort betriebsbereit. Keine Treiberinstalation nötig.Funktioniert tadellos und moderne Spiele spielen macht nun wirklich Sinn mit der stark verbesserten Maussensibilität. Liegt sehr gut in der Hand. fühlt sich qualitativ sehr hochwertig an.DPI läßt sich problmlos über einen Knopf in 6 Stufen einstellen und wird mit LED-blinken angezeigt welche Stufe man aktuell eingestellt hat. 1x blinken = Stufe 1 langsamste DPI, 6x blinken = Stufe 6 schnellste DPI.Wird der PC ausgemacht oder in Standbymodus versetzt, ist die Maus auch sofort im Ruhemodus versetzt um Batterien zu sparen und will man den PC anmachen, einfach an der Maus eine Taste klicken, dann wird PC und Maus wieder aktiviert.Wird direkt am PC eingeschaltet, muß man die Maus seperat aus dem Ruhemodus mit Tastendruck holen. Vorraussetzung ist, das der Schiebehauptschalter immer auf AN ist.Benutzt man die Maus eine geraume zeitlang nicht, schaltet sie sich selbst in den Ruhemodus. Dann einfach eine Taste an der Maus drücken und weiter geht es.Die Tasten sind angenehm zu bedienen und sehr leise. Ich höre zum Glück sehr gut, aber die Maus ist die leiseste von den Klickgeräusche wo ich bisher hatte. Schalter selbst fühlen sich stabil udn haltbar an.Mausrad ist auch präzie mit Stufen zu bedienen. Nicht zu leichtgängig, auch nicht zu schwer und die Rasterstufen sind auch gut vom Abstand her gemacht. Mausrad selbst fühlt sich ebenso stabil udn haltbar an gegenüber den Gummiringen behafteten Plastikrädern wo bei meiner alten Maus schon ewig kaputt ist und mit grauen gutklebenden Klebeband improvisiert habe.Mir gefällt die Maus, macht das was ich für ausreichend schnelle Bewegungen in Spiele, mit Luft nach oben (Stufe 3 für ein Spiel eingestellt) brauche und ist sehr präzise und Reaktionsschnell.Von meiner Seite eine Kaufempfehlung.",5,NA

"15","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Bryan Snow","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","","I've been using the Razer mouse for a few YEARS now(purchased 2022), and it's absolutely phenomenal. The precision of the sensor is unmatched, making it perfect for both gaming and simple web browsing. The hand feel is simply spot-on, fitting comfortably in my hand for hours on end without any strain, not to light and not too heavy. The customizable RGB lighting adds a nice touch, allowing me to personalize my battle station.What stands out most is the durability and build quality, where other mice start missing or double clicking my Razer mouse stands strong. The mouse feels solid and well-constructed, clearly built to last. Plus, the audibly responsive buttons and smooth glide are a dream for anyone who values quick, accurate movements.Obviously, the Razer mouse has exceeded my expectations in almost every way. If you're looking for a top-tier mouse that combines performance, comfort, and style, this is the one to get. Highly recommend!And besides, there aren't any batteries to change or charge! It really is my favorite mouse.",5,NA
"16","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Bryan Snow","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","Outstanding Performance and Comfort; Recommend!","Pros:- software support for razer software suite. Includes macros and every other function you would need.- sensitivity clutch is useful for shooters or as a modifier switch.- ""hyper shift"" the clutch mentioned above can be used to activate a secondary layer of controls. Holding it activates the layer and it's specific bindings, releasing returns to first layer of bindings. This effectively multiplies the usable buttons.- mouse wheel features tactile and speed modes, with additional behaviour customizations as well.- smooth gliding feet, no snags.- braided cable is extremely premium.- wired mouse for those who prefer it (like me)- plug and play . Functional and usable even should you choose not to install the software suite.- durable. I have purchased three basilisk line products from razer. My v2 lasted 2 years and was still perfect when I swapped to a v3. That v3 lasted a year and I just gifted it to my cousin. This one is my 3rd device and I have confidence in this brands durability.- 26k dpi max- supports ""stages"" of sensitivity that can be increased or decreased with two buttons behind mouse wheel. The stages dpi value can be altered using the recommended partner software suite from razer.- stylish design, appealing to the target audience.Cons:- sensitivity clutch is not removable. The v2 version has a clutch that works the same and CAN be removed. This product (v3) has the same but it CANNOT be removed. If this matters to you.Verdict:Many make fun of razer as being an edgelord brand and joke about it, but the truth is gimmicks and image aside every new product I've purchased from them has performed at or above expectations and was durable. This mouse is a great value for its functions when you are using razers connected software suite. However if you do not wish to use a software suite you may desire a mouse with more programmable buttons. This for me though is perfect. Clean because only necessary buttons, yet hyper shift allows me more when needed.",5,NA
"17","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Brandon","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","","This Razer mouse is an incredible value-for-money mouse. It gives you all the features of more professional gaming mice at a lower price. The optical switches are really durable, the ergonomic shape is really comfortable for me, as a righty. The scroll wheel modes are really useful, and the perfect amount of RGB is present. Overall, if you're looking for a high-quality gaming mouse while on a budget, this is a good fit.",5,NA

"20","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Dilan Jiovanni Cano Equihua","Reviewed in Brazil on August 25, 2024","Great Value, Great Mouse","IntroI recently picked up the Razer Basilisk V3, and I’m blown away. Even though I didn’t need a gaming mouse, this one stood out for its features and price, which beat the pricey Logitech MX Master lineup. It’s a fantastic value and has become my new favorite desk companion.OverviewThe Basilisk V3 is a joy to use. Its ergonomic design, customizable buttons, and satisfying scroll wheel make it a productivity powerhouse, even for non-gamers. And let’s talk about the RGB lighting—it’s completely unnecessary but so cool. Customizing it has been more fun than I expected!That said, there’s a slight learning curve with Razer’s Synapse software, but it’s worth investing the time. Once you tweak the settings, you unlock the full potential of this mouse, and it makes a real difference.Final ThoughtsMy only gripe? I wish it were a tad bit bigger—an “XL” or more productivity-focused version would be amazing. But for the price and features, this mouse is unbeatable. Whether you’re gaming or just working, the Basilisk V3 delivers serious bang for your buck. I'll be getting at least one more (to pair with other computers). Highly recommend!",5,NA

"25","Mouse","Logitech 910-005867 M575 Latin America","Roger Sinasohn","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023","","So I've been using Logitech thumb-based trackballs since they were rectangular and connected with a DE-9 serial connection.  I swear by them and have converted many others.The advantages are clear: you don't need huge swaths of desk space to move them around, you can remove your thumb from the ball so you don't inadvertently move the cursor when you click, and the interface is extremely intuitive and easy to use.  The biggest disadvantage is that they are solely right-handed -- my two lefty kids can't use them.  The kids also say they're not great for gaming so that might be a factor; my youngest uses some specialty mouse designed specifically for gaming.As for this particular model, it's not terribly different from the previous M570.  Note: in the pictures, the new M575 has the more silver ball; the one with the more blue ball is an M570.The forward/backward buttons (between the left mouse button and the trackball) are less prominent on the newer model and include indentations that appear to be simple circles.  I'm guessing that the circles are meant to give your finger a reference point to be able to click without looking but I find them more annoying than useful (they feel like there's a piece of dirt or something stuck to them) and the prominent buttons of the M570 were easier to feel, as well as being less susceptible to accidental clicks.The palmrest part of new M575 as some subtle ribbing, probably meant to keep your hand from slipping from side to side but it's honestly just another annoyance.  Not enough to prevent me from using it but given the choice, I would prefer it without.The activity light/battery warning light has moved from just behind the forward/back buttons to the middle behind the main mouse buttons. Not a problem at all, just different.  I will note that the light on the M570 can be seen even when your hand is on the trackball whereas this one is covered up by your hand.The trackball itself is fine; I think I like the old blue color better but there doesn't seem to be any other difference.The bottom of the trackball is not functionally different from the old version and it's good to see that the slot is still there in the battery compartment to hold the receiver.  The power switch is a little smaller and harder to access but still perfectly functional.  There is a new button that appears to switch the trackball from using the receiver to using bluetooth -- a handy feature if you want to use it with something like a tablet, I suppose.  (I've not tried it via bluetooth.)If you're thinking about upgrading from an older M570, you'll feel right at home, for the most part, but I don't think there's any compelling reason to rush right out and get one.  I bought a new one because the scroll wheel on my old one stopped working reliably.  Had it not, I'd still be using the M570.  (Note: I still use an M570 in my office, as does my wife.)If you're new to this style of trackball, imagine laying your hand on a gently curved rest and moving your thumb around.  It's comfortable and less stressful than a traditional mouse and it requires a lot less free desk space.  It doesn't need any particular type of surface; I've used it with it on my leg, on the bus seat next to me, and on my bed.It's not the cheapest device in the world but if you're hesitant to spend $50 on a trackball, you're probably not a heavy or serious user.  Gamers will probably look elsewhere and possibly even pay more; casual users will be looking for something in the $15-25 range.  I'm in front of a computer 8-12 hours per day and I don't mind spending a bit on something to make that experience more efficient and more comfortable.  If you want to try a trackball without spending as much, there are some decent knock-offs on Amazon that should be fine.  But if you don't mind investing in something like this, it's well worth it.",5,NA

Most inconvenient and painful!  Logitech trackball to the rescue! Trackball use cannot cure RSS, but it might do wonders to ease your discomfort/pain as it did (and still does) for me.Nowadays, trackball mice are getting difficult to find as user needs and interests evolve.  I kept searching for a NEW (not refurbished) Logitech trackball and finally found this model.  There are very few changes between this trackball and my previous similar Logitech models; those micro-differences don't matter to me.All I care about is that my new Trackball is working perfectly for my needs.  Scrolling has always been the primary indicator that my trackball was wearing out.  My new Trackball's scrolling is reliable and smooth.If you're still old school in some of your tech habits as I am, this Logitech wireless trackball may be your best replacement or a good introduction to using a trackball mouse.  Wireless, no cords to tangle (or find a spare port to plug into is a big plus!I anticipate I'll get another 10 years of trackball use out of this new model.  And when I'm ready to move beyond this tech level, I'll start my new device search with Logitech.",5,NA

I’ve played around with some settings to make it less sensitive as I wasn’t use to moving things and click dragging.So far it has caused some discomfort in my hand as it’s using muscles that aren’t likely used that way but again that isn’t the device.

This mouse is nearly indestructible.
