Runs Linux Mint 22 nicely, also very cool-no heating issues. I expect it will do as well with windows if you still use microsoft.  This is a nice board. I like it. I'm very happy with it.  This is the 4th computer I've built.  One for windows and then three after I moved up Linux.  This is the nicest board yet. I wonder what boards will lbe like when we all have to upgrade to 128 bit.",5,NA

The board is very stable, no issues whatsoever and provides excellent connectivity. The fact that it has Wifi 6 is even better. I like this antenna unlike the triangular one from the usual TUF series. The only issue though is that despite the ROG branding, it doesn't have a usb-c header for the front panel so be mindful of that. It also has a single ARGB header so if you need more devices to connect with Aura Sync, you'll need a hub. I loved the 2 M.2 heatsinks for the drives since my previous TUF board only had 1. The IO shield fixed as a single unit at the back is great and saved me a lot of pain (yes, fixing an IO shield is a nightmare on some cases!). One callout though is that the Wifi device was not recognized by Windows 11 via a fresh install so I had to connect it via Ethernet, update the drivers from the Asus site and then got it to work. Excellent all-round board to wrap up the AM4 line-up.",5,NA

S","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","","This is a really nice motherboard and was an upgrade over my older & much cheaper B450 that I, by a tragic mistake, dropped (literally) and accidentally broke. Visually, this ASUS motherboard I’ve replaced it with is stunning, much nicer than my last motherboard with larger & better looking heatsinks.For clarification, I bought the WiFi II version of this motherboard. Software-wise, well, I couldn’t get the WiFi or Bluetooth to work right away, but I found the required drivers included on a DVD. After inserting the DVD, there’s clearly marked drivers for the WiFi & Bluetooth. Unfortunately for me, the files didn’t seem to work in Windows 10 for Bluetooth, but it did for WiF, which was more important to me. Windows Troubleshooter couldn’t get the Bluetooth to work, and the drivers I tried from the ASUS website didn’t work either in getting Bluetooth to work. Anyway, it’s not worth returning over or going to great lengths to troubleshoot outside of the windows Bluetooth troubleshooter, as I had a cheap Bluetooth adapter I bought for $5 years ago, which I just plugged in and it worked right away. One of the first things I did also was disable the “armoury crate” auto-download in the BIOS. I thought that for a nearly $200 motherboard, it was strange there were even such bloatware options in the BIOS on top of included Bluetooth I couldn’t seem to get connected to anything. That was something I more expected out of a motherboard in the barely-over-$100 price range.It’s still a 5 (or maybe 4 1/2) star motherboard to me because despite the two little complaints I have about the motherboard, it still functions very well, handling a Ryzen 7 3800X with my H100i cooler quite well while also looking great. The RGB lighting on the motherboard looks great. WiFi works very fast with the included drivers on a DVD. (Although, in 2024, I’d like to maybe see drivers located on a cool USB) I had more fan headers on the motherboard than I had fans, which was nice.",5,NA
"4","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","Zr0Regrets","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024","Super stable and grabbed at a great price!","This board replaced a dying X470 Asus Crosshair VII Hero motherboard. I would have liked to buy an X570 chipset board, but they are out of stock everywhere, overpriced, or used and as a personal rule a motherboard is the only part of a build I won't purchase used.With a 5950x the board out of the box with PBO enabled ran TDC-156, EDC-190, PPT-230. The VRMs were warm but not out of spec or concerning so this board can handle any AM4 CPU you throw at it. It can't match the raw power output of my Hero VII board but unless you have the ultimate golden sample 5950x with a custom loop you should be able to get the clock speeds you want without burning up the VRMs assuming you have solid airflow in your case.I run custom PBO settings that have been thoroughly tested on my old board, I put my old settings in the BIOS on this board and all benchmark scores were matched or slightly improved.One big benefit with going to a B550 chipset from X470 is now I can run my memory at 3600MHz without any stability issues. My old board didn't like anything faster than 3200MHz. Also jumping to PCIe 4.0 for M.2 and GPU is great to have. I moved a 2TB Samsung 980Pro from my old board to this one and while the raw speed difference isn't noticeable the latency is.I saw a lot of complaints about the onboard LAN controller and so far, I haven't had any connection drops or speed issues. I have multiple mapped network drives connected to my PC and move a large number of files back and forth daily and I haven't picked up any dropped packets while monitoring the connection. Asus and Intel just released a new driver in late September 2024 so maybe that resolved some of the issues, but I will update my review if any problems occur. The Wifi and Bluetooth seem fine with my light testing. I have the antenna on my desk in a large open room with a Unifi AP about 25ft and 1 wall away so signal is not an issue. I always use a hard-line connection over Wifi but it is nice to have anyway.As of now my only complaint is the onboard audio, it is a step down from my Hero VII, while they share the same codec, but the Hero VII had an ESS ES9023P chip, and this board it seems does not. I'm in the process of replacing my old external DAC so that issue with resolve itself.I got this board on sale and so far, am very happy with it. I will update my review if any issues pop up. For the price (on sale) it is very hard to beat.Good luck with your builds!",5,NA

"15","Motherboard","ASUS B550-PLUS Motherboard","Vance","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024","","So for my budget build this was a must have ! Already came with the chipset for my cpu choice and was windows 11 ready so this was a no brainer. Out of the box she performed amazing and after messing with her bios settings and installing all the latest drivers she was even more amazing ! Just the speed and efficiency is mind blowing. And with the pci expansions you can pop a fast operating Wi-Fi card in which saves you money starting out so you can spend it elsewhere like for the gpu or psu. Anyway this mobo met all my needs for a comfortable price so I’m glad I picked it up ! I would absolutely recommend this mobo if you’re on a budget and just starting out to building like I am",5,NA
"16","Motherboard","ASUS B550-PLUS Motherboard","Vance","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","Great motherboard!","This motherboard was used for my first micro ATX build. It was actually fun to put together and works amazingly. However a couple caveats in most of the build process because of its small size. PCie ports are there but if you have a slightly big graphics card? No they aren't. That means installing wifi internally is very dubious and difficult (I got a tplink USB wifi 6 product). Additionally NO ARGB 3 PIN ON THIS BOARD. Really have no idea why they would only have a RGB header and no argb to be seen. This means most rgb products WILL NOT FUNCTION unless you get an additional hub. Overall I like this board but it will really cost you 115 dollars at least unless you are using Ethernet and no argb...",5,NA

Plus, the BIOS is user-friendly, so even if you’re not a tech wizard, you won’t feel like you’re disarming a bomb.It supports up to 128GB of RAM, which is way more than I’ll ever use (but nice to have in case I decide to run NASA simulations from my room).

You do lose 2 of the SATA ports if you choose to use the M2 slot, which I don't like, but I've seen several other boards that have this limitation so I'm sure its some type of chipset limitation.It would have been nice if they could have shifted the x16 slot over one slot so that a 2 slot graphics card doesn't cover one of the PCI-E x1 slots, but I just used a PCI-E extender to move the card from that slot to elsewhere.Also: not sure if this is more an issue with the boardboard or the case I used, but I had to disconnect the USB 3.0 front panel header for cabling purposes, and the fit was so tight between the plastic guide and the cable plug that the whole guide came off with it when I pulled it off.  I had to pry them back apart with a screwdriver and then carefully slip the guide back over the pins.  No damager and everything works fine, but that was a bit scary.",5,NA

"29","Motherboard","GIGABYTE B650 Warranty EZ-Latch Motherboard","Rick","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2023","Unleash Next-Gen Performance with the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX Motherboard:","This review is for the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX rev 1.I ordered this board because I was on an older Intel platform and I wanted to try an AMD build again. The AMD AM5 platform suits my needs since it has current modern features and is projected to have a long lifecycle and I anticipate my next upgrade to be in 5 years or so.The GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX was one the lesser expensive and full featured ATX boards with WiFi at the time of my purchase.My build includes:GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX MotherboardAMD Ryzen 7700X CPUCorsair Vengeance RGB RAMZotac GTX 1080 AMP EditionFirst, my dislikes. No printed manual. As a lifelong pc builder, I rely heavily on a manual booklet for basic info such as what slots to install memory in. How to connect front panel power, reset, hdd status led etc. Where all of the headers such as USB and fans are located.Having an online manual is good but is useless if you don't have a spare computer or laptop to use while you build your computer.Thankfully I did not have to use the BIOS flashback feature because the board recognized my CPU, a Ryzen 7700X, otherwise I would have to go online, download the manual and look up the flashback instructions.For the price I do wish that the board included a higher end integrated audio chipset. Features-wise the audio chipset is the biggest disappointment.I did not like is the top most NVME slot right above the GPU slot has a really thick thermal adhesive pre-applied to the heatsink. It is so thick that it bends my NVME drive slightly - not enough to cause any issues but should be noted.One last thing I did not like is the lack of onboard BIOS post code status LED. I had this feature on my previous motherboard and found it super helpful when diagnosing problems.Now, for my likes. I like all of the features. AM5 socket, DDR5, WiFi6, PCIe 5.0, multiple NVMe slots, plenty of USB slots, and of course RGB support. The board itself is great. Build quality is awesome, no issues with build quality or materials.I did run into a few issues though. Although these issues were encountered with this motherboard, they are not Gigabyte's fault necessarily. These issues were mostly to do with the AMD platform and chipset itself.1. The shipping BIOS ""F2"" version did not allow me to enable XMP memory profile. I had to flash the BIOS to the current at the time ""F4"" BIOS.Note that the current BIOS version as of this review is ""F5a"".2. There were a lot of stability or problems with the USB chipset or bus. File transfers over USB were very slow or slower than it should be. I have USB DAC that had a lot of noise during audio playback. These issues were resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers for the B650 from AMD directly and also updating the BIOS.Here are some recommendations based on my experience with the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX.Definitely update the BIOS. In past generations of motherboards it is only recommended to update the BIOS to fix a specific issue you've encountered. However, in modern motherboards there are so many chipsets and features that it is important to keep up to date on BIOS versions to maintain stability, performance, compatibility, and security. AMD seems to release AGESA updates (as BIOS updates) often and this is directly tied to the chipset. Also, download the chipset drivers directly from AMD because they tend to be more up to date than the motherboard manufacturers' website.To flash the bios, just download the BIOS file for your motherboard from Gigabyte's website and extract/copy the file to a USB drive. Reboot and enter the bios and choose Q-Flash. Select the BIOS, and the board will load the BIOS to memory then prompt for a reboot and apply the new BIOS.Aside from the chipset drivers, all other motherboard drivers can be downloaded and installed from Gigabyte.Ever since, updating the BIOS and AMD chipset drivers, I have had absolutely zero issues. Performance is amazing. Stability is solid. I even run a mild overclock using the AMD Ryzen Master app and doing an auto-oc.In summary, I highly recommend the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX if you're looking for an AM5 build. The issues I've had are specific to the AMD platform and not the motherboard itself, however because of this I would not recommend the AMD platform for novice PC builders or if you are not comfortable or familiar with BIOS updates and troubleshooting driver issues.",5,NA
"30","Motherboard","GIGABYTE B650 Warranty EZ-Latch Motherboard","Rick","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","","Install was pretty straightforward with the help of a couple manuals directing where everything should be plugged in. Got an OS installed and the rig has stellar gaming performance.My only two jarring complaints: XMP does not work (when I tried, PC would not boot until I CMOS-reset the BIOS to default settings), and reboot does not work at all. Literally the first place I emcountered this issue was at the reboot done during the OS install. Found out from others online that these are not an isolated issue and is a noted problem with this and some of GIGABYTE's other motherboards.Still works great, but will not recommend any of GIGABYTE's motherboards moving forward on account of this very disappointing pattern of issues. Hence the 1 star. Avoid this and go with a more reliable brand like ASUS. I will bite the bullet and avoid reboots in the meantime until the next chipset generation or two is released. Because I simply have zero confidence in their ability to fix the motherboard under their own warranty, and the only thing that can change my mind is for them to replace it, free of charge, with a board that does not have issues.EDIT (1/20/24)Fast forward a month, and I see my one star is more justified than ever. Since two weeks ago, BSoD after BSoD have been happening, and a lot of my diagnostic work on it points to a bad BIOS (which this rig will not let me update using the provided Q Flash utility), or bad RAM. Some friends suggested turning on XMP will help remedy the issue, but I cannot do this as aforementioned. And the RAM is only a month and a half old, suggesting that either the motherboard's RAM slots are damaged/defective, or it's been steadily damaging it. Could just be bad RAM on arrival, but I find that hard to believe.",5,NA

The NVMe had windows from another PC.  The case had usb 3.0 20 pins which did not fit right into the mobo 20 pin labeled usb and I bent the pins slightly.  I bought an adapter for the usb 3.1 header and it runs just at usb 2.0 speed which is fine for me because there are plenty in the back.  I have not updated the bios nor plan to unless I run into issues of stability.  The board does have plenty of fan headers which is nice to get around too.  The board is heavy but seems well built and the cpu backing seems strong and well put so the cpu aio cooler shouldn't rip or strip the screws.  I did change out the CPU mount for a different one because I didn't like the fact of the mount only pressing down on two sides but that's just me.  I wanted support on all sides.  Bluetooth works great no issues so far on that side either.  All in all I am happy with the purchase.Update: The fans I forgot I had to connect the controller to the case hold the LED button for 3 seconds for the motherboard to have controller of the fan lights. I straightened the pins on the USB header and was able to plug in the front USB 3.0.  You need to be careful as it didn't like to slide in nicely at all hence why it bent the first go around.  I have had no issues with it at all.  I did update the bios since it patched a security flaw. The flashing of the bios was smooth.  I formatted a usb drive unzipped the file from the site and put it on the root of the drive booted into the bios and flashed it no problem.  Wifi has been great along with bluetooth.  So far no issues in performance.",4,NA
