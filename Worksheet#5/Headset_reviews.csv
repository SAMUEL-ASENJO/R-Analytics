Sound quality is fine and the microphone sounds good in any recorded gameplay clips, party members can hear everything very well. They are comfortable enough for an hour or two of usage but a little annoying the longer you use them.Also, if you‚Äôre using on a gaming console, the cable is extremely long and can get in the way if you‚Äôre just plugging into your Xbox or PS controller as it‚Äôs also made to use on a PC. Wish it would have come with an extender for the cable to use on the PC so it wouldn‚Äôt be in the way as much on console, but for the price, I can live with it.",4,NA

The sound quality is clear, allowing me to hear in-game details and communicate with teammates effectively.

"14","Headset","Turtle Gaming Headset PlayStation Nintendo Console","Xeromaus & Family","Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2016","","I'm a HUGE fan of ""low-end"" turtle beach headsets, and I bought these to replace an aging pair of Ear Force PLa's that had served me faithfully for a long time (and still function very well, albeit thanks to a ton of tape work on damage I caused myself stupidly). Considering I paid only ten dollars more for these, the difference is staggering.As others note, they're not a top end headset, but for $40, do you really expect that? Sound is clear and crisp. Mic is clear and loud, without being overly sensitive (and the windscreen performs very well), and connects/disconnects easily... I'm actually using Dragon to type this with the mic in my laptops mic port! Some complain that the mic is inflexible, but I haven't found a position yet that it won't accept and stay with. I do, however, wish they had used the jacketing from the PLa line (ribbed, semi-metallic covering that allowed for total freedom of position) instead of the semi-hard, plastic-feeling overmold on this one.Leather-feel ear cups are VERY well designed and generously padded, they feel very natural on my head and surround my ear with an almost hermetic seal... pressing on the sides of the cups while wearing them yields a noticeable increase in pressure in my ears (you probably shouldn't do this).Entire system is very light (due in part to plastic construction, which doesn't come off feeling as ""cheap"" as other plastic headsets).At 4ft, the cord doesn't give a ton of room, but it was designed to be used with a console controller audio jack, so it doesn't need it... but for use with an mp3 player or laptop, it's great for those that don't need the extra length getting in the way.Some cons:In-line volume/mic control is small and hard to grasp (almost too smooth), and in turn, the volume control knob is very narrow and set deeply in the control box. When you do locate the volume blindly, it's somewhat difficult to roll, but I'm going to assume it will loosen in time. I would suggest moving it closer to the wire's splitter to make it easier to locate blindly, but it's a personal preference some may disagree with.The mic only inserts into the headset in one direction, having a cut out on the mic itself that must be aligned with a tab on the mic jack. It's difficult, though not impossible, to insert it while wearing the headset, so I suggest you choose in or out before you begin using them. I see no reason why this design had to be implemented, and hope future models will omit it.The connecting band has very little in the way of padding across the top of your head. It's not only a very small fill, but it's the same low density, very soft foam used in the ear cups, making it almost ineffective. It's not uncomfortable once you get the fit right for your head (though mine is shaved, your mileage may vary), but it still seems no thought at all went into this design point. Increasing the fill or using a higher density foam could fix this in future models.Each ear cup is connected to one half of the wire, which I personally don't enjoy the feel of, though its double connection design does prevent a lot of twisting that could lead to a single wire design pulling out of it's grommet. The wire(s) itself is very soft and flexible, which while offering comfort, I'm afraid would be easily abraded or pinched.All in all, you would be hard pressed to find another headset that offers more or performs better at or near this price point...it may even be an impossibility. Though PLa's are cheaper and more than adequate, for any looking for an entrance point into the headset market, these are without a doubt the only headset I will ever recommend again. If you need higher performance, just move up the price scale in the turtle beach line, each offering will blow you away.",5,NA
"15","Headset","Turtle Gaming Headset PlayStation Nintendo Console","Blake","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2015","Amazing for the money. Absolutely LOVE these!","For this price point, I can't say anything less than 5 stars for this headset. I was originally going to go with a different product until seeing that the Ear Force Recon 50(X) series, was to release on 9/25/15. I decided to give it a try, and figured why not. For $40 it seemed like a steal!For the most part, it is a steal.PROS:--The headset itself is good looking, at first I thought the green would be a little off-putting compared to the color of my other accessories and peripherals, but it actually looks really great. Of course, this part is subjective.--Very lightweight. This thing only weighs a few ounces, and other than the light sensation of the cups on your ears, you could not even know you have it on.--The mic is detachable, which is awesome.--Further, the mic sounds great. It picks up my voice with a pretty good clarity for an entry-level gaming headset, and the attached covering of the mic essentially works as a pop filter. In fact, I have a fan blowing right by me and it manages to cancel the vast majority of the wind rushing into it from the fan. Solid mic.--The sound is pretty good. Bass and highs are on par for this price point, with the mids being the weakest link of the sound stage. For music and movies it is probably not the best choice, although it would still work more than adequately for those uses. Gaming is where it really shines, and the sound quality is more than good enough for my gaming needs. Footsteps are defined, gunshots and explosions sound great, and voices and dialog sound just fine.--Adaptability and Connectivity: It connects to the Xbox One controller that has the 3.5mm plug-in, and works on any Xbox One controller with the Turtle Beach or Microsoft headset adapter. My controller has the plug directly on it, so it works flawlessly without the need of an adapter. Further, it includes an adapter to change the mic/headphones to two separate plugs and I tested it on my PC and it works great for both sound and mic as well. Even though it is marketed as an Xbox One headset, it works just fine on PC and my iPhone. I don't have a PS4 to try it on, but I would imagine it would work just fine.CONS:--Like mentioned above, the sound is pretty much on par. Nothing special and certainly doesn't blow your mind with audio fidelity. However for this price range I can't imagine it gets much better. Mids could be a bit better with frequency range.--The cord is rather short. Granted, this model is targeted specifically towards the Xbox One, so plugging it into the controller with the cord length is more than enough, and nice because you don't have a huge bundle of cord on your lap when it is plugged into your controller. However, for use with a PC or other device you might need to purchase a 4 pole 3.5mm extension cable to make it a bit longer. I managed to find several on Amazon for a few bucks, so if this is a problem for you I would recommend going the extension cable route instead of disregarding this headset.OVERALL:I rated 5, but would probably give closer to a 4.5. For $40 (current price at time of writing, the day this headset has been released), it is a great deal. I am very happy with it, and use it as my main headset for my Xbox now, and a backup for my PC. Very comfortable, lightweight, sound is more than adequate in terms of quality, and it works with a multitude of devices. For gaming, it is just an all-around great entry-level headset.",5,NA
"16","Headset","Turtle Gaming Headset PlayStation Nintendo Console","Kr","Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024","","This is being written on the first day after receiving this product. This Turtlebeach headset has great audio quality from the headphones an dmic, though the latter has a bit of an echo when it's too close to your mouth. It's poseable and I don't get that effect around 4-7 inches away from my mouth. The mic is also detachable. The instructions are surprisingly good, particularly for people who aren't computer saavy. They mention a splitter cable that doesn't come with the model I ordered, (The 50P model) or the 50x model, only the standard Recon 50 Model.I've tested it in a dell optiplex 5060sff as well as my HP laptop, which both only have a single jack for audio. In the former thanks to the Wavemaxx Audio Pro I  can choose what the headset is recognized s, mere headphones, a headset, speakers, a mic only, etc. The laptop has no such functionality, but will recognize the audio in and out from both headphones and mic all the same. Only it will play the audio of your own voice on the headphones, so be aware if you're planning on using this headset with a laptop.As well, the mic is very strong in that it can pic up a TV at moderate volume from about eight feet away.I bought it for use in voice chatting, recording, and chatting during video games. Unfortunately the cord is VERY SHORT. Far too short for me to uncomfortably use on my PC without being too close to the screen. I'm going to try and utilize my PS4 controller for this and will update whether or not it works.",4,NA

"25","Headset","BENGOO G9000 Controller Cancelling Headphones","JUAN","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024","","I use these for call of duty and youtube some times my oculus 2. The rgb works with a smooth fade out loop although it's not addressable rgb it's pretty nice they even send adapters so it you want to power the rgb when your on xbox or ps5 it's independent from the controller power source (batteries) for pc you can just hook it up.Con the volume and mute switch on mine usually faces inward not a huge problem but sometimes moving around with raise or lower the volume a minor inconvenience if I would have designed it one would be on each side instead.Pros decent sound quality yesterday it saved me from being shot from behind in cod mw 2.0 the surround sound is decently crisp. The company is eager to please to to make sure you like it by the time I got it and started using it after a week they were checking up on how I liked it. After a couple messages back and forth he/she told me about the rgb being independent from the jack. Most of the rgb wired headphones I've seen aren't separated and only work on the pc. Now even watching TV (I have a projector) I can use the rgb. Microphone works as it should noise canceling I never hear complains from other players. The top fabric for comfort is comfortable I'm keeping the plastic they package it with to keep it clean. Each ear side get an addition inch approximately of length for people with bigger heads. The plastic ear cuffs are not going to flex unless to beat it with a heavy object the head band has just enough flex to it. And the microphone can be moved as it's flexible but also turned all the way pointing up . The head jack and usb splitter is pretty long about 6ft or so and it comes with a quality velcro cord piece to roll up for non use meaning if you wanted to you could put it on a headphone stand and hide the cords from you cat so it's not dangling.Suggestions to the company slightly thicker ear cups would be nice I got big ears so they kinda touch the inner fabric of the cuff and if I squeeze a little bit there's a little but of suction in my ears. Change the volume scrolling wheel to a sliding one and put it opposite of the microphone mute switch.Possible issues sometimes the microphone doesn't register on cod mw 2.0. However this is more likely to be call of duty chat program than the headphones because it happened multiple times with other headphones as well.",4,NA

The sound quality it offers for the price is top-notch. Its accurate directional audio is a big plus for games that heavily rely on sound cues. It does the job of pulling you into the game world and helping you notice details such as footsteps or distant sounds that can give you an edge in gameplay.The one issue I've faced is with the USB connection for the headset lights. When I'm playing on my console with a controller, the USB plug dangles as there is no port to insert it into comfortably. It would be awesome if there were a battery-operated option for the lights to enhance flexibility.

"27","Headset","BENGOO G9000 Controller Cancelling Headphones","BasicBoringMom","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024","","I use this with my Xbox Series X.It works as expected for the price. The mic picks up on background noise very easily. So when I‚Äôm playing COD with the fan on I have to manually switch on and off the mic when talking or else it would be a constant stream of background noise being broadcasted to the match/lobby. The volume isn‚Äôt majorly loud when up all the way. But, it is loud enough to hear what you need to.If you get this for an environment that is loud I would say don‚Äôt get it. Get a more expensive one that will have a better mic and higher maximum volume level.If you‚Äôre like me and just needed a basic mic to communicate, listen to music, and/or watch tv so it doesn‚Äôt go through the normal tv speakers then this is perfect imo.",5,NA
