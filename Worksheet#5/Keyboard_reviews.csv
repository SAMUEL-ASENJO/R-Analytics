"1","Keyboard","SteelSeries Worlds Fastest Mechanical Keyboard","Bill_Ben","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024","","The Steelseries Apex Pro is a superb keyboard. (Apology for the superlative!). It has been my favorite for the 10 days during which I tried seven other brands of keyboards.The typing was my easiest and best with this. I found out how much the keyboard wrist pad is useful.This, and other brands, I tried are for committed gamers. I have never played a single game, so you might wonder why I want it.This keyboard is more rugged, more resistant to passionate keyboard pounding during games. This can, and I believe, it does give it extra durability. Of course, durability and feature come with a price, but I have never regretted the keyboard design and manufacturing on that account.I do not want to paraphrase the features which are more than plenty in the ads. I like them all. The keyboard lighting is exceptional compared to others I have tested.My case has to do with guide and instruction the manufacturer publishes with the product. I must say the worst I had been exposed to was Logitech, even though I owned their products for several decades. In their case, it is a flimsy 2-page paper, where essential Logitech write-up shares its space with 9-10 other languages.My primary use of any keyboard is office type. My primary interest in the high-end gaming keyboards is the ability to create and use macros. Those macros can be used in non-gaming software, such as MS Office, Adobe, Movavi, and just about anything else.That was the place where my problem started. Inadequate documentation is common. Manufacturers count on the internet users to provide instructions for any aspect of the advertised features. If you cannot find what you are looking for you are ready for time consuming guesses.Actually, Steelseries Apex Pro is amongst the better ones. Unfortunately, there are those of us users, who had to be spoon fed the instructions despite decades of computer experience.I give Steelseries five stars, even though my initial bad guesses with the keyboard necessitated a return. But guess, the replacement is none other than Steelseries.",5,NA
"2","Keyboard","SteelSeries Worlds Fastest Mechanical Keyboard","P-Town Cracker","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020","Very impressive high quality product","When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board.  After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.Coming from Cherry MX Browns, I had some reservations about OmniPoint.  The Browns have a tactile point which I liked.  I had tried MX Reds, and wasn't a fan of the linear feel.  With these Omni switches being linear, I was unsure but somehow compelled to pass on the Apex 7 with MX Browns and go Pro.  TBH, I was half expecting to return it.  Needless to say.... I was surprised when I hooked this up!First off... dat switch.  Wow.  SUPER smooth.  The inherent scratchiness of linear MX switches is GONE.  It feels like the keycaps are just sort of floating over the brushed aluminum base.  The adjustment ability is unique compared to most mechanical boards, bringing a true Hall Effect switch to people.  (Look up Hall Effect... gets a little complex for explanation here, but very cool)  Actuation can be adjusted from a light brush on the keys (probably overkill) to making the switch bottom out completely.  This can also be done on a per key basis. Lot of range to play with!Another key strength... the RGB lighting.  Its nothing short of fantastic.  The raised caps let the bright and vibrant lighting spill over the board itself, creating a very cool and clean lighting effect.  Even for those who don't much care about RGB lighting, it's very tastefully done here.Typing is unreal.  I spent 15 mins just typing random weirdness on a word doc just for them feels when I first hooked it up.  And for some reason, I find myself with a lot less errors compared to old board with the Browns.  I'd commonly get keypress duplication (as if I held the key down) with that switch, and with these Omni switches, it doesn't happen anymore.  Of course, these Omni switches are much quieter than the tactile Browns given their linear nature.Not much bad to say here.  Some minor gripes would be somewhat ""meh"" software from Steelseries and the keycaps being ABS instead of something like double-shot PBT caps.  The latter feel much sturdier and more premium, and I suppose one could buy some PBT caps if it was a huge issue.  Not sure how that would affect the lighting though.  The small B&W OLED screen in the upper right doesn't add much in reality, but its kind of a geeky fun thing that you can customize with whatever you want.  It does have some functionality with brightness and other features, which is nice to have versus having to use the software.  Also, only the primary keys have Omni switches.  All the F keys, num pad, and extra function keys are on a generic linear switch that feels good enough.  Would be nice to have all keys on omni switches, but it makes sense from a cost perspective and isn't a big deal to me.All in all, fantastic keyboard that towers over my old Gskill in every respect.  I really wish MS terrible updates hadn't bricked old board, but I guess things happen for a reason.  If you have the cash and want a great analog-based mechanical keyboard with adjustable hall effect switches.... this is the one for you.  Very hard to fault this board.  Steelseries done good here.",5,NA

It was “Like new” if you're asking. It is such an exceptional gaming keyboard! The SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Wireless is a game-changer with its compact 60% form factor. The adjustable actuation feature allows for a personalized typing experience, and the HyperMagnetic switches provide a responsive and tactile feel. Not that heavy and not that light. Battery was on 5% on arrival but all good, I just charged it and upgraded the firmware on the app. The RGB lighting is vibrant and customizable, adding a great aesthetic touch. The PBT keycaps are durable and feel premium. Connectivity options are fantastic with Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, and USB-C. This keyboard is perfect for both gaming and everyday use. Highly recommend for those looking for a high-performance, compact keyboard! Ease of Use Is Good",5,NA

"11","Keyboard","AmazonBasics Matte Keyboard QWERTY Layout","Timothy Corcoran","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023","","The Amazon Basics Low-Profile Wired USB Keyboard has proven to be a reliable and budget-friendly solution that exceeded my expectations. I found myself in need of a wired keyboard after my employer implemented a policy prohibiting wireless alternatives due to security concerns. This budget-friendly option has not only complied with the workplace guidelines but has also become a pleasant surprise in terms of performance.The key feel is excellent, offering a comfortable and responsive typing experience. The low-profile design ensures a sleek and modern appearance, and I appreciate how the keyboard lays flat and stays securely in place during use. Its simplicity is its strength, and it's refreshing to find a no-frills keyboard that gets the job done effectively.One of the standout features is the affordability – it's incredibly inexpensive, making it an accessible option for anyone on a budget.

"40","Keyboard","Rii Multiple Mechanical Multimedia Keyboard","Richard Faulkner","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017","","If not all keyboards are 'equal to' each other, this was definitely a 'greater than' all other backlit keyboards I have tried on my Linux system. To begin with, several of the others I have tried were designed specifically for Microsoft or Apple devices and any supporting features or ""drivers"" were only available on those systems. While most would retain the basic functionality of a keyboard, (i.e. you could type the characters on the keyboard into the software of your choice), some would not. My prior keyboard cost well over $40.00 on sale but the led feature was unavailable without enabling it deep in the system through a command line code using XSET. The keyboard would then light up but the numerical keypad was disabled...There are NO such problems with this keyboard in Linux. Just plug it in and begin using it after your computer boots. (I'm old school I guess, I always plug any input devices prior to booting so I can not attest to it being ""hot swappable"".)The keyboard looks great when lit and the characters are easily discernable while not being to large and ""garish"". The size of the illuminated letters on each key are aesthetically pleasing and in well lit situations does not require a backlight to determine the which character/key you are pressing but are still not quite as clear as a non-lit keyboard with printed characters in high contrast. This effect is the same for all backlit keyboards I have tried so far and appears to me to be the limitations of the current materials available for molding the plastic keycaps in a light dispersing plastic. The optional ""breathing"" effect is nice but I will seldom use this feature. The ""sleep"" function I have not yet discovered how to initiate on my system. The accompanying ""User Manual"" is sparse on any instructions with the exception of a small list of key combinations for using the FN + Function keys, (F1-F12), to control the multimedia functions of most operating systems and how to control the led keyboard itself.The light function of this keyboard is ""onboard"" eliminating the necessity of any extra operating system driver or software support.The keys have a nice tactile feel to them and are positioned well for extended use without discomfort. The board itself, while lightweight, has a substantial feel which leads to an impression of quality surpassing other keyboards I have tried which cost much more.If you are looking for a well built but inexpensive backlit keyboard, I feel that this is a very safe investment for almost anyone.There is one more caveat, I am not a gamer so I can not attest to how well this keyboard would function as such. However, if you are firing off a quick email to your mother, or beginning the next great American novel ...",5,NA

In my opinion, it is more attractive and a better RGB experience than other more expensive keyboards.  It's extremely soft and mushy keyed however and I don't use mechanical keyboards so I am used to softer keying and still seemed mushy.  That aspect was workable for me, though it might not be my favorite, but I can see where others would not like it that mushy.For me it has a tragic flaw that might not be a problem for others.  I'm a lefty and map the arrows and keys on the right side of the board for games for my right hand since I mouse left.  I also always map the num lock, which is in perfect index finger position.  This keyboard, unlike any keyboard I have ever used, does not register any keys if you have num lock pressed.  It seems to block other keypresses which messes up my gaming experience.  Again, dozens of keyboards over my lifetime, this is the first time I have ever experienced this.  My guess is they cut corners on the electronics to bring it in at this very cheap price.

"56","Keyboard","Portable Mechanical Keyboard MageGee Backlit","Adam","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022","","I purchased this for under $25, so I will review as such.  I got the yellow keycaps with blue switches.One of my hobbies is to buy dirt cheap mechanical keyboards and mod/improve them as much as I can.  Sometimes I fall in love with them, other times I just give away as custom made gifts.This caught my attention because it is pretty rare to see a removable USB C connection in the right spot on cheap mech keyboards, I've retrofitted one with a after market port and it was such a pain I said I would never bother again.For the price this is a pretty good keyboard, although one of the loudest I have, and I'm currently neck deep in about 15 different mech keyboards.  The switches are soldered on and are Jixian blues.  Reviews aren't great and I would agree. They feel fine but sound obnoxious.  I havn't tried the red switch option of this board but I would go that route if I ever repurchased, probably duller to the ear with similar feel when it comes to this grade switch.However, sound aside this is really nice to type on, and the cheapest 60% with USB C I have seen.  The keycaps it comes with are really nice doubleshots and it came with a bag of extras, even some that don't fit on this board, like number pad big 0 and long vertical enter.  Mine shipped all white and grey, and a bag of yellow modifiers/space/numkey/FN/backspace etc.  Also a red esc cap.I immediately took it apart by removing all keycaps and removing six screws.  Pretty solid board, but a big empty echo chamber of a base.  I added one layer of Zip-n-fit foam to the deep well towards the back, than another full panel layer to the remaining space.  I put 5 layers of masking tape on the back of the board and screwed it back together.This helped a long with the ""pinginess"" and reverb but the switches are still really load.  Replacing the switches will be my next project but a long on as there are 136 pins to solder.  Won't probably be worth it, but it's my wierd hobby and I will report back.My plans for this are my travel board for hotels.  I recently lost a very expensive keyboard in baggage check and would rather just have $25 loss over the aggravation and hassle over a $150 claim with the airlines.  If I was traveling with my wife though, she would tell me to throw this thing through the window because it is so loud.I guess if you are single, or plan to use it in a place with no one around, and budget is a concern and are willing to take it apart and make some adjustments, this is a very good $25 keyboard.  For anyone who has a great mechanical keyboard or are in earshot of 50ft of someone, this probably isn't for you.Edit: I bought another one with red switches.  I highly recommend going with red's, it feels better typing, and sounds 1000% better.",4,NA

Doesn’t matter too much for me because I use a laptop and the keyboard works on that, meaning I can use the functions on there. If you are someone with a desktop, maybe look into another option. Those $100 mechanical keyboards are expensive but well worth it for the quality and overall look and experience for a full desktop setup. I’m actually buying one of those  expensive keyboards and giving this one to my girlfriend who also uses a keyboard with a laptop. She is excited for it, but you may not be if you are using a desktop and not a laptop. Those function keys not working will bother you at some point",5,NA

Just plugged in, hope it lasts a while. Included spare red keys and brief instruction mostly in Chinese. If you want a space saving, clicky mechanical keyboard, this one is well worth the price!",5,NA

It's held up very well and all the keys and lights work just fine. The sounds of the keys aren't too bad, they're a bit pingy/clicky but it doesn't annoy me. Might not be for you if you prefer a quieter keyboard but it's good if you're on a budget. Would repurchase.",5,NA

The magnetic wrist rest stays attached well. The mechanical action on the keys is smooth and satisfying. The LED functions look good and are easy to access and change. I wish it were compatible with LED control software, but I'm sure that would be way more expensive.",5,NA

He loves the “clicky” tactile response to key strokes. It performs well and the light effects are awesome! He spilled soda on it immediately (why, because he’s 10! lol) and we discovered that the typewriter style keycaps and cases were pretty easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone lookin to for a cool, “clicky”, flashy keyboard.",5,NA

"74","Keyboard","AULA F2088 Mechanical Removable Keyboards","RockinBiker","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024","","I bought this keyboard as it was similar to another very expensive copper keyboard, and wanted to try out the format first (old typewriter style).  Glad I did.  I'm a 40 year IT pro, the keys ""feel"" strange and are flat, so fingers have a harder time finding the right key.  I'm used to feeling the depression of a key, so it takes some getting used to.  The key depress clicks and is satisfying, but just a little bit noisy (bad for recording studios, but fine for home or office use).  Light displays are nice - just wish it had a mode that moved with the music!  That would be cool.",4,NA
