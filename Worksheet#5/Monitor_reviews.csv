"1","Monitor","PHILIPS Adaptive Replacement Warranty 221V8LB","Quoleo","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024","","I picked up the PHILIPS 22-inch Full HD display, and I’ve got to say, for the price, it’s an excellent choice. The picture quality is sharp and clear, with vibrant colors that make everything look crisp. It’s not the most expensive monitor out there, but it punches well above its weight. Setup was super easy—just plug it in and go. Plus, it’s got solid build quality, so it feels like a well-made piece of tech. If you're looking for a reliable monitor that won’t break the bank, this one is a solid option",5,NA

I already had an extra monitor arm, which is essential because the stand is not great. However, for the $70 I paid, this is a perfect monitor for my use case as I did not want something too big.",5,NA

"4","Monitor","PHILIPS Adaptive Replacement Warranty 221V8LB","AMA","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024","Good value","My only complaint is that it is not very adjustable. You can turn the screen from side to side, but you cannot adjust the height or tilt the screen forward or back. Or at least not so that this simpleton could figure it out. (I saw another review that listed ""tiltable"" as a pro (vs con) to this product. I wish I could write that reviewer and ask how.) I feel like the screen tilts forward a bit and I wish I could tilt it back. It is subtle, so it didn't show well in pictures, so I didn't bother adding one to this review. However, that being said, it is otherwise a decent product, easy enough to set up and plug in, and I found the image quality to be fine. And to be honest it is better quality than I expected for the price. I got it for $70 and a lot of the other monitors I was looking at online cost a lot more.",4,NA

They look good and work great. I would say the only issue was the size of the bases as they are a little wide and take up desk space, however at this price point they are fine. I solved this by getting a dual monitor mount that clamps to the desk. I am happy with these and would buy again!",5,NA

Can't give specific feedback, but no complaints and seamless integration. Larger than expected, but not overkill. Excellent picture quality, lightweight but seemingly robust. Would buy a 2nd, but large enough to have 2 windows open so the 2-monitor setup is usually required is unnecessary. Excellent purchase",5,NA

"15","Monitor","Amazon Basics 75Hz Panel Monitor","Bradley R.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","","AMAZON BASICS MONITOR ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SETUP…I’ve being amazed by other Amazon Basics products. I was needing a second monitor for my remote work; I didn’t want to spent a lot in case my job description changes to On-Site. So I bought this one for less than $150 after reading other buyers reviews. I’m pleased with the easy setup and the quality that shows in the image. I have used it for three days and haven’t had any issues.  Last night I played some Xbox on it and it work perfectly, the Refresh Rate is fine for that. If you’re on a budget, need a reliable and great sized monitor screen; this is the one.Image brightness is great; it has different settings for all kind situations.I don’t have anything to say about the sound quality because I always use headphones.Great product until now…. Don’t hesitate on buying this for your home office.",5,NA
"16","Monitor","Amazon Basics 75Hz Panel Monitor","Bradley R.","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023","Great Budget Monitor for Remote Work!!!","Overall, the image quality and brightness are remarkable. The built-in USB hub keeps me from having to plug in all my peripherals separately. The speakers are good enough for basic listening intelligibility, but not what I would want to use to listen to music.I bought this monitor to replace an aging 20 inch unit. The AmazonBasics monitor with AOC technology is considerably brighter and clearer than my old one. I used AOC monitors exclusively in the past so I expected good image quality and performance. This model did not disappoint.The buit-in speakers work reasonably well for sounds related to system notifications or spoken words. If you want to listen to music you will need an additional speaker. Thankfully there is an audio out and a headset port built into the monitor.My desk setup has the AmazonBasics monitor and another connected via hdmi to an Anker 553 USB-C hub. The AmazonBasics monitor is also connected to the Anker hub via the monitor’s USB B port. This allows me to leave my webcam, keyboard, and mouse  plugged into the AmazonBasics monitor for a permanent desk setup. When I am ready to work I simply connect the single USB C cable from the Anker hub to my laptop. This single connection gives me access to everything I need thanks to the monitor’s built-in USB hub.When I purchased it in early 2023 it was $150. It is a great monitor at a great price.",5,NA

Brightness is really good, audio is a bit poor quality (not horrible but could be better).",5,NA
"21","Monitor","Amazon Basics 75Hz Panel Monitor","Eljemberth Saavedra","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2024","","A LITTLE BACKGROUND:  I had already owned two small monitors, 24"" each, however recently I was rearranging some furniture in the room, of which both monitors were sitting on top of, and during the moving around one of the monitors fell off.  Well one of the monitors became unreliable and so I started my hunt for a new one to replace it.  NOW THE REVIEW:  Right off the bat two things drew my interest in this 27"" monitor.  1.  The thin beveled edges for a larger usable screen area, and 2. Easier access to the buttons for configuring the monitor.(i.e. brightness, contrast, etc.).  Coming in a VERY close second with #2 is the cost, $99.99($100).  Looking at the cost of other monitors small than 27"" was a lot more!  So, 3 inches more screen area(than my previous monitors) and the features mentioned above for only a hundred dollars? ...OK!  I had purchase two 32in VIEWSONIC monitors not too long ago for another computer, and I really like the monitors, HOWEVER, the one and only draw back with those two monitors is the location of the  buttons for configuring the monitor is in a very bad location to easily access and use, on the backside of the monitor.  I cannot see what button I am about to press!  Hold on!!!  Wait a minute you might be saying right now...  You might be wondering, if not asking,  what about the screen resolution,  what are things on the screen looking like??  Well that is a great question and my answer to that is, as it said, ""a picture is worth a thousand words""...or in this case, $99.99!  I have attach a picture with this review so see for yourself.  MY CONCLUSION: GOOD QUALITY with a GOOD PRICE to Match!  I would like to add one more thing.  After my wonderful experience with this Amazon Basics product, I am VERY impressed with this line/brand!  This brand is as good as the ""big name"" brands(ViewSonic,  Samsung, LG to name a few.) from what I have observed.  I have taken a look to see if Amazon Basics makes a 32in monitor, so far I have not seen one in my searching.  Keep up the great job Amazon Basics, I have been so impressed that I have been searching your brand now whenever I am shopping computer accessories.  I have two, Amazon Basics USB A 3.0 hubs I purchased before I bought the monitors.",5,NA
"22","Monitor","Amazon Basics 75Hz Panel Monitor","Little Chez","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024","Decent monitor for the price","Lovely display, but the sound from the speakers is terrible -- tinny and faint.  I suppose there might be a connection problem, but hard to see how -- just plug cable ends into CPU output and monitor input and you're done.  Sound is audible enough to see a how-to video on Youtube, but not for any kind of enjoyment listening.  So for even reasonable sound quality, you need some actual speakers.",5,NA

I had no issues installing it, and the fuctionality has been great for competitive games where the 240hz might make a difference.I think it's pretty good if you're looking for an affordable 240hz option.The packaging was pretty well done and there was no missing parts and no shipment damages which is what mostly concerns me when buying monitors.",5,NA

I have not found any dead pixels. The included stand is basic but sturdy with only a tilt adjustment. The screen is fantastic, it's bright and the colors are vivid. I'm loving all the space this 34"" ultrawide is giving me. I also love the curve which I wasn't sure of before I tried it. The built-in speakers are maybe laptop quality so I recommend external speakers or a headset. The bottom line is that it's a beautiful screen with great specs at a very good price.",5,NA

This monitor has the overall best stats and cheapest priced. I haven’t bought a monitor because they are so costly and it’s very hard to choose, but these guys have nailed it with the price. The features are absolutely unbeatable without breaking bank. Solid stand. Not to big of a screen size which is perfect for my desk. Super clear visual great for gaming. Hurts my eyes getting used to this much color. I’m actually ordering 1 more and getting rid of my old monitor I use for a driving game. Might do doubles as well.",4,NA
"30","Monitor","Sceptre 24.5-inch DisplayPort Speakers C255B-FWT240","CR","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2024","Get this monitor. Do not waste your time looking elsewhere","The curved screen took some time to become accustomed to. Now, I am trying to figure out how I worked on a smaller flat-screen monitor for so long. The extra real estate is great! If you're a MAC user, ""Stage Manager"" is a perfect companion to this large screen. It allows having multiple programs open but off to the side, so to speak. You can drag them on and off the screen as needed. The plug-and-play setup was easy, with no additional adjustments.My only complaint is the smaller print size. At the highest resolution, the print is smaller than on other screens I've used. Things get fuzzy on lower resolutions that increase the size of the print. To accommodate this, I use more accessibility settings on my MAC to enlarge and put bold elements on the screen. Overall, this is a good value and a good product.",4,NA
"31","Monitor","Sceptre 24.5-inch DisplayPort Speakers C255B-FWT240","Nick Garcia","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2024","","I've had this monitor for just over a week, and it's been great so far.  It's brighter and more vibrant than my previous LG ultrawide that I was using, and once I got the HDR set up and dialed it just looks fantastic.  It looks great while gaming and gives me plenty of monitor real estate for all the windows I need while working.  The speakers aren't the greatest, but I use external speakers or headphones anyway.For the price I don't know that you can find a better 1440p ultrawide monitor.",5,NA
"32","Monitor","Sceptre 24.5-inch DisplayPort Speakers C255B-FWT240","Nick Mowery","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024","Love the additional screen real estate. High resolution. Small print.","I got this monitor as a 2nd one for my gaming pc and for the price, it's been a solid choice. The 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time are awesome for gaming—everything feels super smooth and responsive. The 1080p resolution looks sharp on the 24.5-inch curved screen, and the R1500 curve gives just the right amount of immersion without being too dramatic.It has plenty of ports—two DisplayPorts and two HDMI—so connecting multiple devices is easy. The built-in speakers are okay, not the best in terms of sound quality or volume, but they get the job done if you're not too picky. The Blue Light Shift feature is a nice touch for reducing eye strain during long gaming sessions.The monitor has a sleek, modern look in machine black, and while it's not the most premium build, it's sturdy and does the job. Setup was simple, and adjusting the screen to the right angle was easy.Overall, the Sceptre Curved 24.5-inch Gaming Monitor is a great option if you’re looking for good performance without breaking the bank. It's not the most feature-packed or high-end monitor out there, but for its price, it offers great value and delivers a smooth, enjoyable gaming experience. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable, functional monitor.",5,NA

"34","Monitor","Sceptre 24.5-inch DisplayPort Speakers C255B-FWT240","Tina Polley","Reviewed in Mexico on October 26, 2024","Great Monitor for a Great Price","I actually really like Sceptre's stuff. I've owned a 24in flat for a really long time & it still works, even after some of the LED backlighting blew out.(I just had to max out my brightness). *BUT* That has nothing to do with this particular item.As for this 34in Curve.... I've owned it for about a month & while it works great & has an awesome picture. I'm skeptical about how long the thing is going to function. Here's the problem & it's something that caught my attention, the second I pulled it from the box. The power/control button is odd as hell & looked extremely cheap. I'm not really one to shy away from something new, because new can also mean improved & innovative. The problem here is new, in this instance, is cheap & flimsy.In the time I've used this monitor, I've had 3 instances where it refused to turn on. I've had to keep playing with the power nobbie-jammie & even had to power cycle it a couple times(yank the cable & plug it back in), just to get it to turn on. Maybe this wouldn't be such a problem, if there was a remote or some other way to power it on, but there isn't. All you have is that stupid nobbie-jammie-jawn! I hopw this thing lasts like my little old guy, but my hopes aren't high.",5,NA
